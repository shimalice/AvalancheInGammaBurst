# AvalancheInGammaBurst
This repository is created for the project in OCNC2022.

1. Reproduce the network with transient gamma activity (gamma bursts) (Palmigiano et al. 2017)

1. Calculate distribution of neural avalanches in the network, compared to othe network which has stationary gamma activity
